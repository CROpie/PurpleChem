formAction updateData in DetailsTab component without return update()


DetailsTab sends event dispatch to +page.svelte, function runs invalidateAll()
server: running load
afterUpdate

Solved
requires invalidateAll() (invalidate(/inventory) appeared to work at the start? then didnt.)

	export let data: PageData;

	let { locationsList, ordersList }: { locationsList: location[]; ordersList: order[] } = data;

	$: ordersList // doesn't do anything
    $: ordersList = data.ordersList // auto-updated

cleaner version:
	let locationsList: location[] = data.locationsList;
	let ordersList: order[] = data.ordersList;

	$: ordersList = data.ordersList;

    doesn't work if just let ordersList: order[]

cleanest version, but doesn't allow typescript
    $: ({ locationsList, ordersList } = data)

"Types don't need to be specified for object properties because they are inferred from the desructured object"

Also didn't work for same reason as cleaner version
