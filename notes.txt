Check out database constraints for units instead of having them in a separate table
Look into what sveltekit enums are

Want to show that the project was undertaken in an organized mannner
    User github projects or jira for this
        Even can link a story to a commit

Even worth reverse engineering at this stage to make it look like it was done in this fashion

Include light-dark mode toggle
Include option to change the colour scheme (save choice in profile ??)

-----------------------------------------------

Updating the page after API to tell database what to do.
1 option: invalidateAll() to re-run the load function. requires $: ?

But for something like delete, easier just to remove it from the array. Is that the case with all changes?
2 option: both change the database and change the current data
how does this fit with $: ?

Didn't work in /inventory, because of the component, didn't have access to changing the order directly ???

create

update

delete
